# Optimizing Operations: MIS Recommendations for Geeland International Grocery  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on business process analysis and **Management Information System (MIS) implementation** for a small retail business. The case study, **Geeland International Grocery**, a specialty grocery store, required a structured approach to **optimize its workflows, improve inventory management, and enhance customer transactions**.  

By leveraging **Odoo ERP** for **Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay processes**, this project successfully streamlined sales, procurement, invoicing, and customer relationship management.  

**Note:** Some links in the documentation might not work due to limitations of free-tier access in Odoo.
